Sorry I'm not good at English so I have to use google translate

Brief introduction about me

•You can call me Ichiro or Zio 💫

•As for my personality, I'm a bit shy about starting a conversation and apologizing. I'm a bit afraid of continuing to talk when playing with strangers 💦

•I'm young, so please understand that I may be a bit childish 🌹
